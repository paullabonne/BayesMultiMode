Description: A two-step Bayesian approach for mode inference following 
      Cross, Hoogerheide, Labonne and van Dijk (2024) <doi:10.1016/j.econlet.2024.111579>).
      First, a mixture distribution is fitted on the data using a sparse finite
      mixture (SFM) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The number of
      mixture components does not have to be known; the size of the mixture is
      estimated endogenously through the SFM approach. Second, the modes of the
      estimated mixture at each MCMC draw are retrieved using algorithms
      specifically tailored for mode detection. These estimates are then used to
      construct posterior probabilities for the number of modes, their locations
      and uncertainties, providing a powerful tool for mode inference.
