Description: The testing approach works in two stages. First, a mixture distribution is
      fitted on the data using a Sparse Finite Mixture (SFM) Markov chain Monte Carlo
      (MCMC) algorithm following Malsiner-Walli, Frühwirth-Schnatter and Grün (2016)
      <doi:10.1007/s11222-014-9500-2>). The number of mixture components does not have to
      be specified; it is estimated simultaneously with the mixture weights and components
      through the SFM approach. Second, the resulting MCMC output is used to calculate the
      number of modes and their locations following Basturk, Hoogerheide and van Dijk (2021)
      <doi:10.2139/ssrn.3783351>. Posterior probabilities are retrieved for both of these
      quantities providing a powerful tool for mode inference. Currently the package
      supports a flexible mixture of shifted Poisson distributions (see
      Basturk, Hoogerheide and van Dijk (2021) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.3783351>).
