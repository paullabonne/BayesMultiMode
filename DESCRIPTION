Description: Bayesian methods for estimating the number of modes, their locations and posterior
      probabilities in mixture distributions. Provides functions for (i) estimating a mixture
      distribution using MCMC methods; (ii) simple post-processing (burn-in and discarding
      empty components); (iii) mode inference. The number of mixture components is allowed to be
      unknown a priori and estimated using a Spare Finite Mixture (SFM) algorithm. Currently the
      package supports a flexible mixture of shifted poisson distributions. The shifted poisson
      augments the poisson distribution with a location parameter. More mixtures of discrete and
      continuous distributions are in the pipeline.
