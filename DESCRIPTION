Description: An R package for detecting multimodality in discrete data using Bayesian
      techniques. The approach works in two stages. First, a mixture distribution is
      fitted on the data using a Sparse Finite Mixture (SFM) MCMC algorithm. The number
      of mixture components does not have to be specified; it is estimated simultaneously
      with the mixture weights and components through the SFM approach. Second, the
      resulting MCMC output is used to calculate the number of modes and their locations.
      Posterior probabilities are retrieved for both of these quantities providing a
      powerful tool for mode inference. Currently BayesMultiMode supports a flexible
      mixture of shifted poisson distributions. The shifted poisson is a two-parameter
      generalisation of the poisson distribution where the mean can diverge from the
      dispersion. More distributions (discrete and continuous) are in the pipeline.
