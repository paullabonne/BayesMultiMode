Description: Bayesian methods for mode inference in mixtures of discrete distributions.
      Functions are provided for (i) estimating a mixture distribution using MCMC methods;
      (ii) post-processing (burn-in and discarding empty components); (iii) mode inference
      giving posterior probabilities for each potential mode and associated locations.
      The number of mixture components is allowed to be unknown a priori and estimated using
      a Spare Finite Mixture (SFM) algorithm. Currently the package supports a flexible mixture
      of shifted poisson distributions. The shifted poisson augments the poisson distribution
      with a location parameter. More mixtures of discrete and continuous distributions
      are in the pipeline.
